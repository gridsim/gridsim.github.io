1. Synopsis
===
Gridsim has two distinctive features:

 * Gridsim can model the complex interactions between energy carriers. It is
   not limited to a single energy carrier like electricity or heat.
 * Gridsim should be seen as an open toolbox to quickly design the simulator
 adapted to specific needs.

Hence Gridsim expected users are researchers and developers in energy systems
who need to simulated complex, multi-carrier energy systems with their control
strategies.

The Gridsim simulator benefits of the power of the Python programming language.
A clear object oriented design makes the simulator scalable: the number of types
and instances can be increased while keeping a manageable program structure. New
element(s) types are typically designed by specialising existing elements.
